# GitHub template for FAIR and open research data

This GitHub template is independent of the (research) data and its format. It follows the best practices for open research data as outlined in [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/). It uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to manage releases, issues, and pull requests, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for documentation, and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) for long-term archiving.

## Why use a template (even for small datasets)?

- Share your [open research data](#open-research-data) with others
- Write better [documentation](#documentation) for yourself and the community
- Write more [consistent](#consistency) code and encourage collaboration
- Increase [security](#security)
- Follow accepted [ethics](#ethics)

## Installation

To initialize the template, [generate](https://github.com/maehr/open-research-data-template/generate) a new project, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repository to your local machine and follow this guide.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and run the following commands in the root directory of the repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run prepare
```

2. Complete the following checklist of tasks to customize the template for your project:

- [ ] enable [GitHub security alerts](https://github.blog/2017-11-16-introducing-security-alerts-on-github/)
- [ ] [protect](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-protected-branches) the main branch to enforce a [fork and pull](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) workflow
- [ ] search and replace `FULLNAME`, `USERNAME`, `REPO_NAME`, `SHORT_DESCRIPTION` `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [package.json](package.json), [README.template.md](README.template.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- [ ] change `CITATION.CFF` according to [citation-file-format.github.io](https://citation-file-format.github.io/)
- [ ] setup the [Zenodo integration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)
- [ ] add `ZENODO_RECORD` to [README.md](README.md)
- [ ] add favicons to `./`, e.g. via [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
- [ ] search for `TODO` in the project (mostly documentation) and fix it
- [ ] delete [README.md](README.md)
- [ ] rename [README.template.md](README.template.md) to [README.md](README.md)
- [ ] run `npm run format` to format all files
- [ ] run `npm run commit` to commit all changes
- [ ] run `npm run changelog` and include the output in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] enable [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages)

## Use
